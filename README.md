## Description

Horiseon is a webesite that informs its consumer on how to market oneself on the internet. It provides its clients with information on Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing. It also provides users access to helpful resources on Brand Awareness, Cost Management, and how utalize Lead Generation. The point behind this project was to refactor the current html and css so that it is optimal for web accessibility. The hope is that the codebase has been edited to be cleaner than when it was found.
